Abstract
--------------
A hybrid manufacturing process combining abrasive
jet and laser micromachining enables the creation of
living hinges in nitinol that retain the superelastic
properties of the bulk material. The former selectively
etches through the thickness of a workpiece and the latter
defines the partâ€™s final geometry. Because the majority of
the material removal is done with the room-temperature
mechanical etching procedure, thermal damage to the part is
minimized. Processing parameters to achieve desired
geometries are described, a bending stiffness model for the
living hinges is provided, and validation experiments are
presented. Lastly, to demonstrate the usefulness of these
components to millimeter-sized robotic systems and medical
devices, we show their integration in two prototype devices:
an endoscopic camera wrist and a simple laser beam steering
system.
