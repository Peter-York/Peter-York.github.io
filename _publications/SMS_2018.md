**Abstract**:We present an ultra-thin meso scale piezoelectric actuator consisting of a piezoceramic beam and
a carbon fiber displacement-amplification frame. We show that the actuator can be designed to
achieve a wide range of force/displacement characteristics on the mN/μm scales. The best
performing design achieved a free displacement of 106 μm and a blocked force of 73 mN,
yielding a total energy density of 0.51 Jkg-1 for the 7.6 mg system. We describe a printed circuit
MEMS process for fabricating the actuator that incorporates laser micromachining, chemical
vapor deposition, and precision carbon fiber lamination. Lastly, we report the incorporation of
the actuator into a microgripper and describe other promising application opportunities in microoptics
and micro-laser systems.
