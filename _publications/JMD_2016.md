Abstract
--------------
This paper presents a miniature wrist that can be integrated into
needle-sized surgical instruments. The wrist consists of a nitinol
tube with asymmetric cutouts that is actuated by a single tendon
to provide high distal curvature. We derive and experimentally
validate kinematic and static models for the wrist and describe
several prototype wrists, illustrating the straightforward fabrication
and scalability of the design. We experimentally investigate
fatigue life, the concept of tip-first bending, and practical use of
the wrist with a concentric tube robot in an endonasal surgical
scenario.
