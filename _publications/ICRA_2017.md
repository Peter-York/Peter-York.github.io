Abstract
--------------
Piezoelectric materials are an attractive option for
electromechanical transduction on the mesoscale due to their
intrinsic high force production, large bandwidth, and favorable
scaling characteristics. However, the small displacements they
inherently produce are typically too small to be directly used in
robotic systems, and thus displacement amplification is needed.
Here we present a piezoelectric actuator that uses geometric
amplification to achieve 20 the nominal piezoelectric displacement.
Actuator performance is described in terms of blocked
force (20 mN), displacement (115 m), bandwidth (3 kHz), and
power density (172 W/kg). The actuator is fabricated using
printed circuit MEMS, an emerging mesoscale manufacturing
paradigm. Expected applications include locomotion for terrestrial
crawling robots and flapping wing micro-air vehicles.
