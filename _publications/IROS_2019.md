**Abstract**: Laryngeal cancer treatments, while curative, often
lead to voice impairment. Minimally invasive surgical methods
that facilitate greater preservation of healthy tissue have recently
emerged, but they are still limited in important ways. In
this work, we describe a device that combines the advantages
of the two primary minimally invasive approaches: the high
quality incision and reduced post-operative pain achievable with
transoral laser microsurgery and the superior visualization and
tissue manipulability afforded by transoral robotic surgery.
Our 11mm diameter scanning system connects to focusing
optics and a fiber optic laser source and can direct a laser
beam across a 18 x 10 mm plane with controllable trajectories
at speeds up to 7 m/s. We describe its design and benchtop
validation and present avenues for further development within
a clinical environment. While oncological treatment is a natural
first application area for this technology, we anticipate that it
may also yield important benefits for the minimally invasive
treatment of benign laryngeal diseases.
