Abstract
=============

The needle-sized surgical tools used in
arthroscopy, otolaryngology, and other surgical fields
could become even more valuable to surgeons if endowed with
the ability to navigate around sharp corners to manipulate
or visualize tissue. We present a needle-sized wrist design
that grants this ability. It can be easily interfaced with
manual tools or concentric tube robots and is straightforward
and inexpensive to manufacture. The wrist consists of a
nitinol tube with several asymmetric cutouts, actuated by
a tendon. Perhaps counter-intuitively, within this seemingly
simple design concept, design optimization is challenging due
to the number of parameters available and nonlinearities
in material properties. In this paper, we examine a subset
of possible geometries and derive kinematic and static
models. Experimental results with a 1.16 mm diameter
prototype validate the models. Lastly, we provide a discussion
summarizing the lessons learned in our early experience
designing and fabricating wrists of this type.
