For this new course taught by my dissertation advisor, I created a demonstration showing the mode shapes in a guitar body that result from different strings being plucked. I used a Polytec PSV-500 scanning laser Doppler vibrometer to measure the vibration amplitude throughout the guitar body. A small plucking robot provided repeatable stimulus to the strings. The vibration velocity at a single point on the guitar body was measured each time a string was plucked. The visualizations that I created from the measurements were part of a lesson on standing waves and Hemholtz resonators. A summary video is shown below:
