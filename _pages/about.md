My aim is to transform the way **robotic tools** are deployed in **surgery**. I draw  on advances in microfabrication, millimeter-scale actuation and sensing, and compliant-mechanism synthesis and a broad suite of mechanical and electrical engineering skills.

My academic background is in mechanical engineering. As an undergraduate (BEng, Vanderbilt, 2014) I worked under Prof. Robert J. Webster in the [Vanderbilt Medical Engineering and Discovery Lab](http://research.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/MEDLab/), and as a graduate student (PhD, Harvard, 2020) I worked under Prof. Robert J. Wood in the [Harvard Microrobotics Lab](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/). I am currently a post doc with Prof. Wood, working on translating my dissertation research into an early-stage investable technology.

My work is summarized on this site, from projects to academic publications to teaching. Thanks for stopping by, and please reach out to me at my [email](mailto:pyork@g.harvard.edu) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-york-robotics/) if you're interested in connecting or in collaboration.
